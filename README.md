# FTX Account To Spread Sheet

A script to pull account summary and positions from FTX into a spread sheet.

Provides quick access to data that is not shown on the FTX web site, including:

- total account position size (total of all futures and margin borrows)
- total account collateral (accounting for coin collateral fraction)
- total realized PnL for perps and futures
