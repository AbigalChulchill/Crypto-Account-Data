# FTX Account To Spread Sheet

A script to pull account summary and positions from FTX into a spread sheet.

Works in Excel and Google Sheets.

Provides quick access to all data. Includes data that is not shown on the FTX web site, such as:

- total account position size (the total of all futures and margin borrows for the account)
- total account collateral (total for the account, net of coin collateral fractions)
- total historic realized PnL for perps and futures

Can be customised to change the account data and tickers imported.

Data can be pulled in from main account and sub accounts.

The script runs on local machine. Using CCXT crypto library and running in PHP.

## HOW TO

## INSTALL CCXT

Get CCXT and install it where you want to run it.

https://docs.ccxt.com/en/latest/install.html

https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt

## PHP

PHP can be installed on Windows, Mac and others from this link.

https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php

You may be able to run everything on your web server. Then PHP would likely already be installed.

## RUN THE SCRIPT VIA A LOCAL WEB SERVER

Download index.php and account.php and put them next to CCXT folder.

Open a terminal / shell window and CD to the directory where you put the script.

$ cd /Users/mac/Desktop/folder/

Start the basic web server that is builtâ€“in to PHP using this command:

$ php -S localhost:8000

Leave the window running in the background.

Now test the script, it should run in a web browser at this address.

http://localhost:8000/

Loading this page should get data from the exchange and show it in the web browser.

## PULL DATA INTO MICROSOFT EXCEL VIA WEB QUERY

This was tested on Mac Excel v16.57

Go To: Menu: Data: Get External Data: Run Web Query

Make a copy of the SampleWebQuery01.iqy file, or just modify the existing one.

Change the address to your local server that was set up.

http://localhost:8000/

## CREATE A TUNNEL FROM INTERNET TO THE LOCAL SERVER

Only necessary for Google Sheets and running scripts locally. Not needed for Excel.

Sign up for a free account at Ngrok.com

Start a tunnel with a terminal command like this:

$ ./ngrok http 8000

Ngrok will now show you the external address for example:

Forwarding https://eabb-89-38-69-33.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000

Leave this terminal window open and running in the background.

## PULL DATA INTO GOOGLE SHEETS VIA IMPORTHTML

In Google Sheets, create a new sheet and add the following cells:

In cell A1: The address provided by ngrok service like https://d399-185-99-252-211.ngrok.io

In cell B1: Type the following: ?a=

This adds an arbitrary variable to the URL, which is used to refresh the data.

In cell C1: Create a tick box using Menu: Data: Data Validation.

In cell A2: Add this formula: =IMPORTHTML(CONCATENATE(A1,B1,C1), "table", 1)

The data table will populate down from A2.

When you tick or untick the box, the data will be refreshed.
